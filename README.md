# Mute-Shape-Keys
A tiny Blender addon to mute/unmute and flip shape key mute status. I am sick and tired of needing to click that little checkmark on every single shape, aren't you?

## Supported Versions
Native version: 3.6 LTS - briefly tested and working in Blender 4.0.0

## How-to-install
Download the muteshapekeys.py file. In blender, go to "Edit" -> "Preferences" -> "Addons" -> "Install Addon" and pick the .py file on your computer.

## Usage
The location of the two buttons is in the 3D Viewport -> Tools. 
The buttons will only show up if a mesh with shape keys is selected.
