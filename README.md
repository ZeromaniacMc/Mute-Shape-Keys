Zeros Shape Key Utils
A tiny Blender addon to mute/unmute and flip shape key mute status as well as moving shape keys around faster. I am sick and tired of needing to click that little checkmark on every single shape, aren't you?

## Supported Versions
Native version: 3.6 LTS - briefly tested and working in Blender 4.0.0

## How-to-install
Download the zip from the releases section. Add the entire zip to your blender addons, do not unpack or unzip.

## Usage
All buttons are located in the shape key context menu, specifically at the top of it.
