# Zeros Shape Key Utils
A tiny Blender addon to mute/unmute and flip shape key mute status as well as moving shape keys around faster. I am sick and tired of needing to click that little checkmark on every single shape, aren't you?

## Supported Versions
Native version: 3.6 LTS - briefly tested and working in Blender 4.0.0

## How-to-install
Download the zip from the releases section. Add the entire zip to your blender addons, do not unpack or unzip.

## Usage
All buttons are located in the shape key context menu, specifically at the top of it.

## Credits
I do not know python at all so I cannot take credit for this, however I know some Java and am learning C# as of the V2 release, so I was able to co-pilot chatGPT to write correct code and feed it blender documentation references to make it work. See it as proof of concept that you don't need to know code to generate code :P

## Support
I don't mind if you contact me about issues with this plugin. Just know it works perfectly for me in blender 3.6 and 4.0, so chances are, chatGPT can tell you why it's not working for you and even fix it faster than I can.
